The incident was witnessed by local meta-ethics professor, Mortimer Black.

> He saw the workers and I suppose he must have made a split-second decision to maximize the utility of the commons by voluntarily jumping down from the bridge to get in front of it

The event bears a remarkable resemblance to _The Trolley Problem_, a well known meta-ethical thought experiment in which an oncoming trolley imperils the lives of five rail workers operating in a narrow tunnel. The agent in the thought experiment sees the situation, as they stand behind a sixth man, who is innocent, but fat and oblivious to their presence. The agent and the fat man stand atop a bridge with no guard rails that passes over the tracks. The agent must then decide whether to save the lives of the five rail workers by pushing the fat man off the bridge and onto the tracks to stop the trolley.

When asked about his working relationship with The Trolley Problem, Mortimer Black barked defensively

> Obviously it was a train rather than a streetcar so the Trolley Problem model can't be applied here. _**No consequentialist scholar would mistake this situation for a trolley problem, obviously**_.

Police say the investigation into the witness's story is still ongoing.
