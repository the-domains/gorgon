The incident was witnessed by local consequentialist scholar, Mortimer Black.

> He saw the workers and I suppose he must have made a split-second decision to maximize the utility of the commons by voluntarily jumping down from the bridge to get in front of it

The event bears a remarkable resemblence to _The Trolley Problem_, a well known metaethical thought experiment in which an agent may save the lives of five imperiled rail workers if they are willing to bring about the death of a sixth man by pushing him from the bridge to intercept the trolley passing underneath. 

When asked about his working relationship with The Trolley Problem, Mortimer Black barked defensively

> Don't ask me about the trolley problem. Obviously it was a train rather than a streetcar so the model doesn't apply. No consequentialist would mistake this situation for a trolley problem.

Police say the investigation into the witness's story is still ongoing.
